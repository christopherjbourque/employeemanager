# Title
Employee Manager


## Description
Employee Manager is a simple server-based CLI application that allows users to view employees in the database, add new records as well as add, create and delete records.


## Motivation
I undertook this project to increase my knowledge and understanding of Node.js and Express as part of my coding bootcamp program.  The project uses a number of native and third party modules and API and HTML routes.  While the app itself is not groundbreaking, the code may be particularly interesting to those trying to learn or who have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, and Express.


## User Story
**As a** user,

**I want to** be able to (1) view existing departments, roles, and employees, (2) add departments, roles, employees, and (3) updated existing roles

**So I can** maintain accurate records of who the employees are in my organization, what role they are in, what department they are in, what they get paid, and who they report to.


## Acceptance Criteria
The application should allow users to
+ view existing departments, roles, and employees.
+ add new departments, roles, and employees.
+ update roles.

## Prerequisites
No special hardware or software is required to use this web app.  All that is required is a modern browser and installation of the node packages.


## Installation
The app does not need to be installed.  It can be run directly from the browser.  If you choose to download the app files to view and possibly play with the code, do not forget to run npm install so all node modules required to run the app locally are installed.
